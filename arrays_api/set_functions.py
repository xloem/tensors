    Parameters
    **********
    
    *   **x**: *<array>*
    
        *   input array. If ``x`` has more than one dimension, the
            function must flatten ``x`` and return the unique elements of
            the flattened array.
    Returns
    *******
    
    *   **out**: *Tuple[ <array>, <array>, <array>, <array> ]*
    
        *   a namedtuple ``(values, indices, inverse_indices, counts)``
            whose
    
            *   first element must have the field name ``values`` and must
                be an array containing the unique elements of ``x``. The
                array must have the same data type as ``x``.
    
            *   second element must have the field name ``indices`` and
                must be an array containing the indices (first
                occurrences) of ``x`` that result in ``values``. The array
                must have the same shape as ``values`` and must have the
                default integer data type.
    
            *   third element must have the field name ``inverse_indices``
                and must be an array containing the indices of ``values``
                that reconstruct ``x``. The array must have the same shape
                as ``x`` and must have the default integer data type.
    
            *   fourth element must have the field name ``counts`` and
                must be an array containing the number of times each
                unique element occurs in ``x``. The returned array must
                have same shape as ``values`` and must have the default
                integer data type.
    
            Note: The order of unique elements is not specified and may vary
                between implementations."""
